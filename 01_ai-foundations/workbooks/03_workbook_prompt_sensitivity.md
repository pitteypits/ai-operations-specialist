# In-Class Workbook: Prompt Sensitivity (10 minutes)

Paste this into a Google Colab cell and run it. It's the same greedy
pipeline from `genai-demo/colab_full_cycle.py`, wrapped in a function so
you can try many prompts quickly.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

MODEL_NAME = "gpt2-medium"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
model.eval()

def top5(text):
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors="pt")
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(input_ids)
    next_token_logits = outputs.logits[0, -1]
    probs = torch.softmax(next_token_logits, dim=-1)
    top_probs, top_ids = torch.topk(probs, 5)
    print(repr(text))
    for p, i in zip(top_probs, top_ids):
        print(f"  {tokenizer.decode(i)!r}: {p.item():.3f}")

top5("I think the answer is")
```

## Task 1: One character can change everything

Run both and compare the top-5 predictions.

```python
top5("I think the answer is")
top5("I think the answer is,")
```

Write down what changed: Adding just a comma changed the entire top-5 distribution. “yes” dropped from 17.8% to 6.3%, and new tokens such as quotation marks, “we” and “you” became more likely. This shows that next-token probabilities are highly sensitive to context.

<summary>💡 What's happening</summary>

Adding a comma changes what kind of token is grammatically likely to
come next — the model isn't reasoning about meaning, it's predicting
what character/word pattern statistically follows the exact sequence of
tokens it was given. A trailing comma, space, or punctuation mark can
shift the whole distribution because it changes the model's expectation
of sentence structure.

## Task 2: Confident vs. ambiguous prompts

Run all four. For each, look at the probability of the #1 token — is it
close to 1.0 (very confident) or spread more evenly across the top 5
(uncertain)?

```python
top5("The capital of France is")
top5("The capital of that country is")
top5("My favorite color is")
top5("The most important thing in life is")
```

| Prompt | #1 token probability | Confident or uncertain? |
|---|---|---|
| The capital of France is | | |
| The capital of that country is | | |
| My favorite color is | | |
| The most important thing in life is | | |

<details>
<summary>💡 Answer</summary>

Factual, narrowly-constrained prompts ("The capital of France is") tend
to produce one dominant, high-probability token (" Paris"). Prompts with
many reasonable continuations ("My favorite color is", "The most
important thing in life is") spread probability more evenly across the
top 5 — there's no single "correct" next word, so the model is less
confident. This is a preview of why some questions get consistent
answers from an LLM and others get different phrasing every time.

## Task 3: Try your own pair

Write two prompts that differ by only a word or two, where you predict
the completions will diverge a lot. Run `top5()` on both and see if you
were right.

```python
top5("your_prompt_1")
top5("your_prompt_2")
```

## Discussion (2 minutes)

If small wording changes can shift what a model predicts, what does that
imply about how careful you need to be when writing prompts for a
production system — and why might the same prompt behave differently
across model versions?
