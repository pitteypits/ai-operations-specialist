# In-Class Workbook: Greedy vs. Sampling (10 minutes)

Paste this into a Google Colab cell and run it. It rebuilds the same
`probs` distribution from `genai-demo/colab_full_cycle.py`, then always
picks the single most likely next token — this is called **greedy
decoding**.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

MODEL_NAME = "gpt2-medium"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
model.eval()

text = "The cat sat on the"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors="pt")

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(input_ids)

next_token_logits = outputs.logits[0, -1]
probs = torch.softmax(next_token_logits, dim=-1)

# Greedy: always the single most likely token
next_id = torch.topk(probs, 1).indices[0]
print(text + tokenizer.decode(next_id))
```

## Task 1: Sample instead of picking the top token

Replace the last two lines above with a **sampled** token instead of the
greedy top choice. `torch.multinomial(probs, num_samples=1)` draws one
token ID, weighted by its probability.

```python
# TODO: replace `next_id` with a sampled token
next_id = torch.multinomial(probs, num_samples=1)[0]
print(text + tokenizer.decode(next_id))
```

Run it 5 times in a row. Did you get the same word every time? Did any
surprise you?

No. With sampling, the next token can change between runs because the token is drawn probabilistically rather than always selecting the highest-probability option.
Yes. Some sampled tokens were less obvious than the greedy choice, which shows that lower-probability tokens can still be selected.

```python

## Task 2: Generate 10 tokens with sampling

Wrap the pipeline in a loop, feeding each new token back in as input.

```python
generated = input_ids

for _ in range(10):
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(generated)
    next_token_logits = outputs.logits[0, -1]
    probs = torch.softmax(next_token_logits, dim=-1)

    # TODO 1: sample the next token id from probs
    next_id = torch.multinomial(probs, num_samples=1)
    # TODO 2: append it to `generated`
    generated = torch.cat([generated, next_id.unsqueeze(0)], dim=-1)

print(tokenizer.decode(generated[0]))
```

<details>

```python
next_id = torch.multinomial(probs, num_samples=1)
generated = torch.cat([generated, next_id.unsqueeze(0)], dim=-1)
```

`next_id` needs shape `[1, 1]` to concatenate along the sequence
dimension, hence `unsqueeze(0)`.

## Discussion (2 minutes)

Greedy decoding is deterministic; sampling is stochastic. Which would you
want for a chatbot? For a customer-facing summarizer? Why might
inconsistency be a problem in production?
